# Compressed Sprite
 This version of the Sprite is schematically identical to the master branch, but uses smaller surface-mount components to reduce the board footprint from 3.5x3.5 cm to 3x3 cm. Because it is schematically identical, the users' manual from the master branch also applies to this board.
